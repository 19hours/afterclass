COR-IS1702,"- Pre-assigned under Prof Cheng Shih-Fen.  - (Experience) Love-hate relationship with CIS-1702 but thoroughly enjoyed this mod. Very fulfilling when I think about the solution to tutorial, project problems but very frustrating and *normal* when I stumble on a question for very long (few hours, even days for me). Amongst all year 1 IS mods, this mod is the most enjoyable for me though it is also the most intellectually challenging.  - (Workload) Extremely high workload for me as a Y1S2 IS student, spent at least 32 hours per week (4 days) to prepare for next week's lesson and do the tutorial questions. The learning approach is blended learning where we are expected to (1) learn from the pre-recorded lectures on Youtube (Prof Hady's lectures), (2) attempt the self-check quizzes on eLearn and (3) do the tutorial questions before each class so that we clarify our doubts for the topic during class time. I used 1-2 days (morning to evening) to go through and take notes for next week's lecture, 2-3 days (morning to evening) to do the tutorial questions and review the code files provided. Most time consuming for me (cater at least 2 days to do one tutorial) as questions are challenging but doable.  - (Project) Struggled with project as some questions are very challenging and we may need to learn other algorithms on my own to solve the project questions. It is important to have solid understanding of each topic week by week to apply to the project. I had some question mark on certain questions from previous weeks and struggled to clear these questions before starting on the project. Start the project once it is released. Ask for help from instructors if necessary.  - Coding assistance were provided by the teaching team tp make use of to ask questions as well (I regret not using it for the project).  Advice to do well and enjoy this mod - Good math foundation (permutations, combinations, circular permutation, logarithm properties, arithmetic series, geometric series) for deriving big O notation. - Good python foundation (good to know how to implement a class) for understanding the code files provided and implementing algorithms for tutorial, project and exam questions. - Prepare ahead for each lesson (Prof Hady's youtube lectures are very well-explained so cater time to go through the videos) - ""If I can't code it, I don't understand it"" is a good motto. One strong recommendation to get a solid understanding of the concepts are (1) write my own class implementation for each data structure (Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Graph, ...) and (2) re-code the algorithms taught. When in doubt, then refer to the code files provided to get a glimpse of what the code is doing, then get back to coding the class and algorithms on my own. After coding it out, compare with the code files provided and compare my code with the code files' codes for improvements. These greatly strengthened my understanding of the concepts taught.","- Good if there are videos from the teaching team going through the thought process when coding the functions, class implementation for the code files provided.",True,True,True,True,False,Anonymous,,"Computational Thinking equips students to tackle complex computational problems; it trains students to design solutions to solve those problems using a computer program.  It draws upon concepts from mathematics and computer science – more precisely, discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm design.

IS111,"I learnt Python just before school started, so I had some headstart. I generally found what is being taught manageable and easy enough to understand, but difficult to master without consistent practice.   I found the lab tests generally manageable, but the questions at the end can get quite challenging. For example, for LT2 2021, one of the questions at the back took about 60 lines for me to solve (was very lucky to solve it). I would strongly advise people to return None or empty list for questions they cannot do, as they might award some marks for doing so. The lab tests are generally not easy to score past 20/25 for each of them (not giveaways). I strongly recommend people learn how to use the debugger on Visual Studio code themselves, and also how to debug in general. Also, checking after each step by using the print function is very useful and time-saving, as it avoids the need to find the bugs in the code which can be very difficult and stressful under timed conditions. I really advise people to do all the practice questions and past lab test questions, as they can really help in building up problem-solving skills.   For the finals, for my semester (2021-22 Sem 1), it was much more manageable than the lab test, but was slightly tricky. Each question is not too long or complex, and most of my friends managed to attempt almost every question. The downside of finals is that code cannot be run, so mistakes may be made unknowingly (idk how many mistakes I accidentally made). So maybe code more slowly?? Consensus is that finals are easier and meant to pull overall grades up.   Quizzes are pop quizzes which means that they suddenly appear. There were 4 pop up quizzes throughout my semester. Questions are either MCQ, predict the output, multi-select, and paper coding. Paper coding only appeared for the last quiz for my prof.  Lastly, I realised that it is very useful to learn outside the syllabus, especially list and dictionary comprehension. They drastically decrease the number of lines needed to be written and can solve the problems more elegantly. More practice is needed to be able to confidently apply it in exams to save time.","More emphasis on paper coding. The final exam is about paper coding, but yet I find that there is not enough emphasis on coding correctly without being able to run the program. It is way easier to make coding mistakes when paper coding than what people think. More specialised coaching sessions should be provided to students that need it, as it is easy to fall behind.

IS214,"In summary, this is one of the one of the worst modules I took so far as a 2nd Year IS student. The expectations of the module vs. the reality of it through the project is drastic. Experience in cloud technologies, networking concepts, how to create and manage a server is INSANELY ADVANTAGEOUS.   Recommendation to juniors: Do not overload the semester with other tough module. ESM, ESD and DBTT are likely to be taken together; all 3 have considerable amount of quizzes, assignments and projects. Deadlines are back-to-back for project submission. (Seek more advice from seniors for clarification.)  Read below to find out what is bad: For the classes, they teach the bare minimum for technology concepts — like networking — and how to use cloud technologies — like Amazon EC2. However, for the project, we are expected to know how to use things like CIDR blocks, private subnets, scripts and come up with an insane architecture to achieve that 'A' grade. Their teaching on how to use Linux CLI is so minimal, then they expect us to trawl through the entire Amazon EC2 image they provided to clean up the entire EC2 instance.  Given what I explained, the professors get 'upset' when we seek help from seniors., and I quote ""your seniors are making too much noise"".

One thing I do have to precaution others considering his class is that he does expect students to revise terminologies that were taught or told to look up (in the first lesson one of his self-reflection questions is learning how a phone works). It can be very broad sometimes so students have to really be open with learning new things via self-research.

For example, in the exam there are 40 questions, there are 10 questions roughly from each prof. However, when looking at their slides on e-learn, all profs teach very different things. This means that students are only able to answer questions set by their prof, and the rest is up to guesswork. MOST if not all of the questions are vague and extremely subjective.  The grammar for half the questions is wrong and riddled with spelling mistakes and errors, which leaves me to wonder, who is responsible for vetting the content of the course exams?   The course flow (UI/UX design) is completely out of sync, and the order in which content is taught does not make any sense, it is just jumping around different topics with no logical flow. Most of the slides are outdated (at least 10 years old), and course content is mediocre at best, with irrelevant topics and terms thrown around. Project work was (shockingly) even worse than the exams themselves. Project load was ridiculous, and we spent a good 20-30 hours a week on this course alone.   The Prof and Instructor did not grade according to the rubrics, and I don't know how this went unnoticed, but there is absolutely no preparation between instructors.

SMT202,"Ok, so I am writing this just a few days after my final presentation in this module just to give context. The profs Tan Kar Way and Hwee Pink are fairly reasonable and Prof Tan Kar Way has good teaching skills and is generally good when consulted. Additionally, given that this is a SMU-X module, it is expected that the sponsors will differ and hence the scope of research would vary from batch to batch.  Now onto my experience. The research on vaping among different audience caused significant advantages and disadvantages across all groups. While groups targeting universities and parents have fairly manageable reach to their audience, groups reaching polytechnic and ITE students had struggle to find a sample dataset as those in the earlier groups. Additionally, instructions should have been made such that surveys and interviews could be started earlier rather than after midterm presentation pitch, which by then is quite late. Some groups actually ignored the profs' instructions and went ahead with surveys and interviews which, again, gave them huge advantage to getting analysis before other groups that actually listened to the profs. Lastly, the sensitivity of the topic itself made it difficult for interviews to be held which caused even more delay in collecting data for analysis. The only few things that I felt were actually good were the compulsory prof check-ins via consultations. Even I disliked the fact that both classes were mornings so hopefully there is at least an afternoon class if you're hoping for one.  Overall, some things could have been managed better so that everyone is in the same playing field and that data collection for surveys and interviews could have been earlier.
